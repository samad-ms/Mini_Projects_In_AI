### 4. EmailSparkAI  
**Description:** Streamlit application for generating various types of emails with different styles (formal, appreciating, not satisfied, neutral) using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model.  
**Features:** Offers templates for various job-related emails, enabling users to customize the email topic, sender name, recipient name, writing style, and signature. Its interactive interface simplifies email generation, and it uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate responses based on user inputs.  
**Technologies:** Python, OpenAI, LangChain, Streamlit.

### 5. Sentiment Analysis on IMDB

**Description:** This project involves training a logistic regression model to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset. It demonstrates various data science and machine learning techniques, including data preparation, feature extraction using TF-IDF, model training, evaluation, and tracking experiments with MLflow.

Features: Splits data into training and test sets while stratifying by sentiment, uses TF-IDF Vectorizer to transform text data into numerical features, trains a logistic regression model with specified hyperparameters, evaluates the model using F1 score and visualizes performance with a confusion matrix, and logs parameters, metrics, and artifacts using MLflow for reproducibility and experiment tracking.

**Description:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, **MLflow**, Logistic Regression, TF-IDF.


### 6.Fine-Tuning Llama 2 with QLoRA
Description: This project focuses on fine-tuning the Llama 2 model using Quantized Low Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) in a Google Colab environment. The goal is to efficiently adapt large language models to specific tasks with minimal resource usage.
Technologies: Python, QLoRA, Google Colab, Transformers, PyTorch, Hugging Face Datasets, BitsAndBytes.
Contribution üí°

### 7.MNIST Classification Project with Hydra
Description: This project is a simple example of image classification using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using a ResNet model.
Technologies: Python 3.x, PyTorch, torchvision, Hydra.
(Hydra is a framework for elegantly configuring complex applications, including managing configuration files, command-line options, and environment variables, making it easier to build and maintain scalable and configurable software systems.)

### 8.Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction
Description: Predicting the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using Ridge Regression. This model utilizes features like Temperature, RH, Ws, Rain, FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, FWI, Classes, and Region. Ridge Regression is chosen for its ability to handle multicollinearity.

Technologies: Python, Ridge Regression.
repo: https://github.com/samad-ms/fwipredictor

### 9. Chest Cancer Classification Project
Description: Developed a Chest Cancer Classification project focusing on adenocarcinoma cancer, achieving 92% accuracy using the VGG16 model. Implemented within an MLOps framework (mlflow) with an end-to-end pipeline. Also, developed a user-friendly interface for the application.

Technologies: Python, Deep Learning, MLOps, Docker, DVC, CI/CD, AWS, Flask, DagsHub.
repo: https://github.com/samad-ms/Chest-Cancer-Classification-Using-mlflow-and-DVC

### 10.Diabetes Prediction ML Classification Project
Description: This project aims to predict diabetes based on health data, including features like pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, and more. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection (Logistic Regression), and model deployment.
